    <h1>Teaching Philosophy</h1>

    <p>
      My classroom is an environment built for learning and exploration. My
      classroom is energetic, academically rigorous, and open for input.
      Students are encouraged to "jump in" with their ideas at almost any time.
      Whether my class is taught in person, or online, students are encouraged
      to participate in the conversation and to "find their own voice" during
      learning activities.
    </p>

    <p>
      I model my activities and assignments from research-proven techniques
      such as multiple low-stake assessments, pair sharing, relevant and timely
      feedback on student assignments, active learning activities, and many
      more. I look to the Universal Design for Learning and have studied
      pedagogy through On Course, Project-Based Learning, and USC Equity Now.
    </p>

    <p>
      I encourage students to push themselves academically while maintaining
      achievable goals for all students to be able to succeed. I design
      activities that take into account cultural relevancy and students' own
      lived experiences.
    </p>

    <p>
      My students are treated as humans and equals. In my classroom, we are all
      people striving toward similar goals, and it's only in this moment that I
      am the one standing in front and guiding. I encourage my students to
      share their own experience and expertise in the classroom. I model how
      their expertise builds the experience for the students. We look to each
      other to fill in the gaps.
    </p>

    <p>
      My classroom is a place of open wonder and query. We seek answers
      together. I model growth mindset as way to reach higher levels of
      achievement.
    </p>

    <p>
      My students succeed in an equitable and inclusive environment. My very
      high success rates have shown over the years that students are successful
      in my classroom across both race and gender boundaries.
