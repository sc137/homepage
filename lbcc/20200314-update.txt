Hello Everyone, 

I hope that you are all doing well and and staying healthy. Our class is going to avoid meeting on campus switch to remote class meetings for the next couple of weeks - starting Wednesday. The goal is to help mitigate the potential spread of COVID-19. Many of us have already had an opportunity to try out the ConferZoom feature already. We will use ConferZoom for a live meeting during class time for the next three weeks.

What does this mean for us and how will class continue this week?

** Do not attend class at PCC this week. **

First: Login to Canvas

You will see an informational landing page there with some information for connecting to ConferZoom. We will meet LIVE during class time using Zoom Wednesday at 6:30pm. Please attend if you are able to using ConferZoom in canvas.

I have crafted a ConferZoom How-To page for you here:

https://lbcc.instructure.com/courses/45159/pages/conferzoom-how-to

Some things to note about our remote class session:

This is not an online class. We are meeting live using ConferZoom software.

We will be meeting during class time using ConferZoom. I will host the meeting and share my browser or programs with you. We will be able to talk with each other if you have access to a microphone. We will use the break out room feature for group work.

If you choose to use your mobile device to connect - you can install the Zoom app on your phone and login that way. Please connect to Wi-Fi. The session will use lots of data.

Quizzes will continue to be available each week. Plan on taking the labs after 6:30pm on the class day. Labs will continue to be due each week. Please turn them in when you can - I am not going to mark late work down in points. My goal with the labs is for you get hands-on as much as possible.

Everything is going to be VERY FLEXIBLE for the next few weeks.

I have current information in the canvas shell right now. I will continue to update that.

Please feel free to email me with any questions or concerns you have. I'm sure I haven't covered them all here.

Thank you for you patience during this time of change.

Sincerely,

Sable Cantus
