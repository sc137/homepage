            Encrypt Your Tax Docs BEFORE You Send Them
          </h1>
          <p>
            It’s that time. We all are doing our taxes online now. Some of us
            need some help and that usually ends up with digitally sending tax
            documents.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em
              >Do not ever, under any circumstance, email a document that has
              your <strong>SSN</strong>, <strong>home address</strong>,
              <strong>phone number</strong>, <strong>bank information</strong>,
              etc. unencrypted. That is a good way to lose all of your money
              and even your identity.</em

            I use two free services to send my encrypted documents out:
            AESCrypt and Dropbox. You can use any online file sharing service
            for this for this step such as Google Drive, OneDrive, sync, etc.
          </p>
          <h3 id="step-1-install-aescrypt">Step 1: Install AESCrypt</h3>
          <p>
            Get AESCrypt installed on your computer. Go
            <a href="https://www.aescrypt.com">here</a> and install for your
            platform.

          <h3 id="step-2-zip-up-all-of-those-files">
            Step 2: Zip up all of those files
          </h3>
          <p>
            You want to send one encrypted blob of data. Put all of your files
            into a single folder and zip that up. On the Mac, select the file
            and go to File &gt;&gt; Compress “Sensitive Docs”.
          </p>
          <h3 id="step-3-encrypt">Step 3: Encrypt</h3>
          <p>
            Follow the directions for your platform to encrypt your zip file.
            On the Mac, drag the file onto the dock icon and enter a strong
            password when prompted.
          </p>
          <p>
            I suggest using a secure password generator like the one over at
            <a href="https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm">GRC.com</a>. You can
            also use Lastpass or whatever you use (even the commandline) to
            manage your passwords. Make a note of that password though. You can
            keep a copy of the password in TextEdit or NVAlt – the documents
            are already on your computer.

            Steve Gibson recommended, on the
            <a href="https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-599.htm">Security Now Podcast</a
            >, to use a long string of numbers that can easily be read over the
            phone such as, “32 67 89 14 75 12 99”, etc.

          >
            Step 4: Drop it in Dropbox Using Dropbox makes sharing files easy.
            Put the encrypted file into your dropbox folder and click Share
            Link.
          </h3>
          <p>
            You can send them the file directly through the Dropbox website or
            get the link and send it separately.

            Step 5: Send the Password via a Separate Method
          </h3>
          <p>
            If you send an email with a link to your encrypted document, it
            doesn’t make sense to put the password into that email.
            Additionally, you might not want to send the password from your
            account to that same account. Try to send the password over
            iMessage, Signal, or another instant messenger, or to a secondary
            email address the person has.
          </p>
          <p>
            This would be a good time to send them the
            <a href="http://cantus.us/posts/decrypt-tax-docs.html"
              >decryption instructions</a
            >
            if they need some help.

          <p>
            Once the recipient has confirmed that they have the documents and
            have decrypted them on their own machine you will remove the
            encrypted documents from Dropbox. Sure they are safe, but there is
            no reason to keep that online.
