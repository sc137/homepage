# Cantus.us

*a new homepage for [cantus.us](http://cantus.us)*

In the old days you had to pay for a hosting account, install some type of server software, pick a database, and maintain it all. Also, that has a cost of time and money.

This version is taking a bootstrap template (saving time) and using gitpages (saving money). I decided to be lazy though and just dumped all my old posts, tutorials, rants, etc. There will be new stuff added to the posts folder. I will link to them directly via [twitter](https://twitter.com/sablecantus).

Bonus, keeping up on github, vc, moving domain names, etc. :-)
