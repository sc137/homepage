# cantus.us

*a new homepage for [cantus.us](http://cantus.us)*

we used to get ahold of a hosting account, install some type of server software, pick a database, and maintain it all. that has a cost of time and money.

this version of the site is taking a bootstrap template (saving time) and using gitpages (saving money) to get on the internet. I decided to be lazy though and just dumped all my old posts, tutorials, rants, etc. into the ether. They are gone. There will be new stuff added to the posts folder. I will link to them directly via [twitter](https://twitter.com/sablecantus).

bonus: keeping up on github, vc, moving domain names, etc. :-)
