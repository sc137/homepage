Hello Everyone,

We are meeting on ConferZoom tonight at 6:30pm for our regularly scheduled class meeting. All of the details about the college, the courses, and even our lives have been changing from hour to hour. I appreciate your patience and your dedication to stay up to date.

We will complete this course together. Our plan, so far, is to meet during class time using ConferZoom. This will be virtually in person. We will have live video and chat. We are going to group up using "break out rooms" and we will have interactivity with zoom polls, poll everywhere, etc.

You are not required to use video or participate with audio. Please use the chat to ask questions and respond to conversation prompts.

More features may be added our Canvas shell as we need them.

There is a class discussion in canvas for Week 6 and a student discussion specifcally for the lab. Let's help each other out as much as possible.

Here is a direct link to my ConferZoom Student Guide. Feel free to share.

Important to note: LBCC is closed to the public and to students. Do not got to campus for any reason at this time.

College updates.

The college is updating us progressively throughout the day every day. I'm not certain what you have heard exactly. It's best not to speculate in this situation. I'm sharing the pertinent items from this afternoons latest update.

* Long Beach City College will continue the temporary remote instruction/online until the end of the 2020 Spring Semester. This means that students and faculty will continue the temporary remote instruction through the end of the Spring Semester.
* At this time, the new anticipated date of return to campus for LBCC employees (with exception of those who have been deemed essential personnel) is Mon., June 8, 2020. The anticipated date of return for students and the members of the public to campus is the first day of Summer Session on Wed., June 10, 2020. However, these dates may change as the COVID-19 health crisis evolves.
* There is a high likelihood that the Summer sessions will be conducted solely online.
* A decision about the 2020 LBCC Commencement Ceremony has not be made at this time.  

LBCC has a dedicated information page available for us to check as well:

Thank you again for your patience. I look forward to seeing you online tonight.
