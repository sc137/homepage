Hello Everyone, 

I hope that you are all doing well and and staying healthy. Our class is going to avoid meeting on campus switch to remote class meetings for the next couple of weeks - starting Tuesday. The goal is to help mitigate the potential spread of COVID-19. Some of the classes at GWC are going remote starting at spring break. In an abundance of caution we are going to meet using confer zoom beginning immediately.

What does this mean for us and how will class continue this week?

First: Login to Canvas https://www.onlinegwc.org

There is a course shell already for us named DM110-60691 (F2F) Digital Audio, Introduction. Please click on that.

You will see an informational landing page there with some information for connecting to ConferZoom. We will meet LIVE during class time using Zoom Tuesday at 6:30pm. Please attend if you are able to using the zoom link.

Here is some good information to get you started connecting to a zoom meeting:

Some things to note about our remote class session:

This is not an online class.

We will be meeting during class time using Zoom. I will host the meeting and share my browser or programs with you. We will be able to talk  with each other if you have access to a microphone.

If you choose to use your mobile device - you can install the Zoom app on your phone and login that way. Please connect to Wi-Fi. The session will use lots of data.

Be careful if you need to go out to get wifi during class time. I think many students may be at the college in the LRC using shared computers and staying in close quarters.

Everything is going to be VERY FLEXIBLE for the next few weeks.

I have current information in the canvas shell right now. I will continue to update that.

Please feel free to email me with any questions or concerns you have. I'm sure I haven't covered them all here.


Thank you for you patience during this time of change,

Sable Cantus
