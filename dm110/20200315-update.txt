Hello Everyone, 

The district has elected to cancel all classes this week. We will then have spring break and return to our planned remote class session on Tuesday, March 31st.

Here is the exact wording from the district office:

"With a growing level of concern due to COVID-19, all onsite and online classes will be suspended beginning March 16 through March 20 out of an abundance of caution, followed by Spring Break the week after as planned."

You can read the entire message here:

>>> This means no class Tuesday night. <<<

Please work on your 8 Track project if possible.
